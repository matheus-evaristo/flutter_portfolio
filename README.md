## <span id="about">About</span>

 As a software engineer, I wanted to make a live (constantly updated) dynamic web portfolio to replace my old classic text résumé. In my constant watch for technology trends, I wanted to learn more about Flutter SDK and Dart programming language for a while, so I've decided to give it a try and make my live portfolio using it. 
 
 In future iterations of this application, I intend to document better how to clone and make your own portfolio version.
