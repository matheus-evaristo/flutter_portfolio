# Note

All markdown files in `./excalidraw` folder were made using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian note taking app</a> with <a href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin">Excalidraw extension</a>. For easier visualization without having to install Obsidian plus the extension, I've exported the sketches as PNG images in `./images` folder.

# Disclaimer

I'm not a UI/UX professional, so I've made these prototypes and the overall application visual layout, design and experience purely from intuition and personal tastes.
